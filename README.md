# FINAL-PROJECT_IN-VEHICLE-COUPON-RECOMMENDATION


This data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and asks the person whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. The objective is to develop an effective prediction model to determine whether a driver will accept a coupon based on the provided scenario.
